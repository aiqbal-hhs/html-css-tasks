    <h3>What did this scp 2399 do?</h3>
<p>"Well the scp seems to fired something since it has been repaired by some drones that have been send by its head that shot a massive energy pulse shot heading to targeting "<strong>Earth</strong>" everyone on earth was depending on me and my friend but we were already too late we could do anything but just watch with fear in our eyes as this mystery energy pulse slowly approachs to earth. Sigh, I guess it was all for nothing then, but If you dont know who scp 2399 is Then it's ur lucky day Because to save a Video in my save file we needed it to find out more about this creature but now that i dont need it you can watch it for yourself its right next to Video "The last Man" anyways I hope Someone or anyone This is Dr. Beckett going off... "access denied" oh come on really nevermind ill just try and Reset the Powercore how do I turn this of-.*MESSAGE CUTS*"</p>
