    <h3>What did this scp 2399 do?</h3>
<p>Well the scp seems to fired something since it has been repaired by some drones that have been send by its head that shot a massive energy pulse shot heading to targeting "<strong>Earth</strong>" everyone on earth was depending on me and my friend but we were already too late we could do anything but just watch with fear in our eyes as this mystery energy pulse slowly approachs to earth so yeah that was the year 2045 the day we planned to damage it more before it finishs repair itself, This is Dr. Beckett and i am out for today.</p>
